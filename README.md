# CoinScreenCap 
i wrote this app with kotlin and MVVM. i used "coin ranking free API" to show a list of crypto currencies with details in a recycler view.i implemented a favorites list that you can fav and unfav coin.
i wrote this app to learn Room data base and use some transaction.
i use these libraries to develop this app :  lifeCycle - TabLayout - navigation component - Room - recyclerView - Hilt for DI - Coil - corutine - paging - swipeRefreshLayout - Retrofit.
now i decide to improve my UI/UX skills in coinScreenCap too.
IT CONTINUES...
